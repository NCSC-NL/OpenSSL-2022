## Identifying


### Docker

Docker has provided an experimental tool for verifying docker containers for containing a vulnerable OpenSSLv3 version. 

Required tool: https://github.com/docker/index-cli-plugin

```bash
docker-index cve --image $IMAGE DSA-2022â€“0001
```

### Windows

#### Powershell

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path "C:\" -Filter "libssl*"
```

### Microsoft Security Solutions

#### Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Microsoft has published a blogpost with instructions for identifying Azure resources with OpenSSL installed using Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

### Linux

#### System-wide version
```bash
openssl version
```

#### Running processes running OpenSSL 3.x 
```bash
sudo lsof -n | grep libssl.so.3 
```

#### OSquery OpenSSL version check for Debian based systems
```
select name, version from deb_packages where name like "openssl" and version like "3.0%";
```

#### OSquery OpenSSL version check for Fedora/CentOS based systems
```
select name, version from rpm_packages where name like "openssl" and version like "3.0%";
```
