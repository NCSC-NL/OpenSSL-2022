# OpenSSL overview Scanning software

This page contains an overview of any scanning software or tools for getting insight in used OpenSSL version. 

**NCSC-NL has not verified the scanning software listed below and therefore cannot guarantee the validity of said rules.
However NCSC-NL strives to provide scanning software from reliable sources.**

## Identifying

### Docker

Docker has provided an experimental tool for verifying docker containers for containing a vulnerable OpenSSLv3 version. 

Required tool: https://github.com/docker/index-cli-plugin

```bash
docker-index cve --image $IMAGE DSA-2022–0001
```

### YARA rules

Akamai has provided a YARA rule for identifying OpenSSLv3 versions. More information: https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/openssl-vulnerability-how-to-effectively-prepare

```
rule openssl_version {
	strings:
		$re1 = /OpenSSL\s3\.[0-6]{1}\.[0-9]{1}[a-z]{,1}/
	
	condition:
		$re1
}
```

In case we don’t want to rely on the string, we can also look for the main application that relies on OpenSSL, but parsing the executable’s imports. This is a less foolproof method though, and should be treated as such.

```
rule pe_import_openssl {
    condition:
        pe.is_pe and
        (
            for any i in (0..pe.number_of_imports):
            (
                pe.import_details[i].library_name contains "libcrypto-3" or pe.import_details[i].library_name contains "libssl-3"
            )
        )
}
```

### Windows

#### Powershell

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Path "C:\" -Filter "libssl*"
```

### Microsoft Security Solutions

#### Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Microsoft has published a blogpost with instructions for identifying Azure resources with OpenSSL installed using Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
Blogpost Microsoft: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/new-openssl-v3-vulnerability-prepare-with-microsoft-defender-for/ba-p/3666487

#### M365 Defender / Azure Sentinel
```
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory
| where SoftwareName contains "openssl"
| where SoftwareName contains "3.0" or SoftwareVersion contains "3.0"
| project DeviceName, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion
```

### Linux

#### System-wide version
```bash
openssl version
```

#### RHEL, Fedora, Oracle, CentOS:

```
rpm -qa --queryformat "%{NAME} %{VERSION} %{RELEASE}\n" | grep openssl
```

#### Running processes running OpenSSL 3.x 
```bash
sudo lsof -n | grep libssl.so.3 
```

#### OSquery OpenSSL version check for Debian based systems
```
select name, version from deb_packages where name like "%openssl%" and version like "3.0%";
```

#### OSquery OpenSSL version check for Fedora/CentOS based systems
```
select name, version from rpm_packages where name like "%openssl%" and version like "3.0%";
```

#### Search your nix store for OpenSSL 3.x (NixOS)

```bash
# List references to openssl in your current system
nix-store -qR /run/current-system | grep openssl
# Find out why those references exist
nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command why-depends --all /run/current-system /nix/store/<some-openssl-3>
```

You can then override as appropriate or monitor the progression of the fix to releases, [read more here](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/openssl-3-0-7-update-2022-11-01-faq/22875)

### MacOS

#### OSquery OpenSSL version check for MacOS based systems using homebrew package manager
```
SELECT * FROM homebrew_packages WHERE name LIKE "openssl" and version like "3.0%";
```
#### Checking homebrew packages without OSQuery
```
brew list --versions | grep openssl | grep "3.0"
```

### Splunk
#### Regex statement to use in Splunk
```
rex field=_raw "(OpenSSL\/|libssl\.so\.|openssl\.so\.|openssl-|openssl-libs-)(?<SSLversion>[0-6]{1}\.[0-9]{1}\.[0-9]{1}[a-z]{1}|[0-6]{1})"
```
#### Query:
```
index=* OR index=_* TERM(openssl) OR TERM(libcrypto-3) OR TERM(libssl-3) OR term(libssl) NOT TERM(tls1.2) NOT sourcetype IN (splunkd_ui_access, audittrail, splunkd_remote_searches)
| rex field=_raw "(OpenSSL\/|libssl\.so\.|openssl\.so\.|openssl-|openssl-libs-)(?<SSLversion>[0-6]{1}\.[0-9]{1}\.[0-9]{1}[a-z]{1}|[0-6]{1})"
| where isnotnull(SSLversion)
| stats values(SSLversion) AS SSLVersions by host, sourcetype
| sort -SSLVersions
```
